## Introduction

The following maps display the incidence of child abuse/neglect cases [reported to Illinois Department of Children & Family Services](https://childabuse.illinois.gov/). Incidence is broken down to the census tract level for Cook, Peoria, and Vermilion counties from 2016-2021.

Briefly, we tallied the number of cases for each census tract and then divided by the census-estimated population. We filtered out all cases whose addresses were reported at healthcare or childcare facilities as we were more interested in primary addresses for cases. Because incidence is aggregated into census tracts, privacy remains preserved since information about single addresses is obscured.
